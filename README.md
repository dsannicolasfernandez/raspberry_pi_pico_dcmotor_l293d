# Raspberry Pi Pico with DC motor and Motor controller L293D

What We Need
As usual, I suggest adding from now to your favourite e-commerce shopping cart all needed hardware, so that at the end you will be able to evaluate overall costs and decide if continuing with the project or removing them from the shopping cart. So, hardware will be only:

A common computer (maybe with Windows, Linux or Mac). It can also be a Raspberry PI Computer board
Raspberry PI Pico microcontroller (with a common micro USB cable)
L293D chip
DC motor
breadboard
breadboard power supply module
